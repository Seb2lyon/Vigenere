# Vigenere Cypher
Encode a sentence using the Vigenère Cipher

This little console program (in French) was developped in C langage.

You should input a clear sentence that you want to code, then an alphabetical key (without space or punctuation).
The program will provide an encoding sentence created by the Vigenère algorithm, keeping the original spaces and punctuations.

Enjoy ;-)

P.S : this is my first code in C... don't hesitate to give me some comments
